% Find the eigenvalues and the associated eigenvectors of A matrix.
% Solve x'=Ax analytically.
%
% The characteristic equation for an 9x9 matrix to determine the 9
% eigenvalues is in general an nineth order polynomial.
% By Abel's Impossibility Theorem : In general, polynomial equations higher than fourth degree 
% are incapable of algebraic solution in terms of a finite number of additions, subtractions, multiplications, divisions, and root extractions.
% Directly using the function eig in Matlab to determine. 
% The output is not given in analytic form.
% For the initial condition: x0 = [0 0 0 0 0 0 0 10degree 0]
% Substitute the initial condition into the A matrix.
